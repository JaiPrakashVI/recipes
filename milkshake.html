    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Chocolate Milkshake is our most favorite variety of milkshake, hands down. This beverage in general, is more popular in the west, especially in USA, where a meal of burger and fries is never complete without a milkshake. But in the past few years, this milk-based beverage has become quite common in the Indian food scene too. The Chocolate Milkshake Recipe remains the quintessential choice for kids and adults alike. In this post, I have shared a super easy, quick and yummy way of making this milkshake with cocoa powder.</p>
