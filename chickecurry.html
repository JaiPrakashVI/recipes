    <h2>WHAT IS CHICKEN CURRY </h2>
    <P> Chicken Curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish that brings together tender pieces of chicken simmered in a rich, creamy sauce.</P>
    <P> The curry is infused with a blend of spices including curry powder, cinnamon, and paprika, which create a warm and inviting aroma.</P>
    <p> The addition of fresh ginger and garlic adds a zesty kick, while the coconut milk and yogurt provide a luscious, creamy texture.</p>
